\arguments{
\item{Y_unval}{Specifies the column of the error-prone outcome that is continuous. Subjects with missing values of \code{Y_unval} are omitted from the analysis. This argument is required.}

\item{Y}{Specifies the column that stores the validated value of \code{Y_unval} in the second phase. Subjects with missing values of \code{Y} are considered as those not selected in the second phase. This argument is required.}

\item{X_unval}{Specifies the columns of the error-prone covariates. Subjects with missing values of \code{X_unval} are omitted from the analysis. This argument is required.}

\item{X}{Specifies the columns that store the validated values of \code{X_unval} in the second phase. Subjects with missing values of \code{X} are considered as those not selected in the second phase. This argument is required.}

\item{Z}{Specifies the columns of the accurately measured covariates. Subjects with missing values of \code{Z} are omitted from the analysis. This argument is optional.}

\item{Bspline}{Specifies the columns of the B-spline basis. Subjects with missing values of \code{Bspline} are omitted from the analysis. This argument is required.}

\item{data}{Specifies the name of the dataset. This argument is required.}

\item{MAX_ITER}{Specifies the maximum number of iterations in the EM algorithm. The default number is \code{2000}. This argument is optional.}

\item{TOL}{Specifies the convergence criterion in the EM algorithm. The default value is \code{1E-4}. This argument is optional.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE}, then show details of the analysis. The default value is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
\item{avg_pred_loglike}{Stores the averge predicted log likelihood.}
\item{pred_loglike}{Stores the predicted log likelihoood in each fold.}
\item{converge}{Stores the convergence status of the EM algorithm in each run.}
